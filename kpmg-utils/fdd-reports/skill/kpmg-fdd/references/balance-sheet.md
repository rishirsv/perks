## Core rule

Use this section as an incremental deep-dive on balance-sheet composition and account mechanics that extends `historical-financial-performance`.

The section must read as client-ready diligence writing: factual, period-anchored, and explicit about balance-sheet structure, estimate-sensitive captions, financing profile, and comparability implications.

Global writing, placeholder, and language rules are defined in `references/global-writing-conventions.md` and apply here.

## Writing guidance

1. Start with a quantified headline that states total assets, total liabilities, equity position, and the primary balance-sheet movement over the review period.
2. Show the balance-sheet schedule before narrative commentary.
3. Structure commentary in this order: `Current assets`, `Non-current assets`, `Current liabilities`, `Non-current liabilities and equity`, `Reconciliation and comparability`.
4. Quantify major caption movements and identify component drivers inside each category (for example, trade receivables, inventory, prepaid assets, deferred revenue, accrued liabilities, related-party balances, and financing obligations).
5. State collateral, encumbrance, and repayment profile facts where they affect interpretation of liquidity, debt capacity, or transaction mechanics.
6. Distinguish trade, non-trade, and related-party balances where classification influences WC, net debt, or QoE interpretation.
7. Explain accounting-policy or presentation reclassifications that affect period comparability (for example, movement between cost captions or current/non-current classification changes).
8. Use concise source notes for sensitive or non-obvious facts and avoid repeating source statements in every bullet.
9. Keep unresolved interpretation inside `Comparability implications for diligence analysis`; do not create `Open items` or `Data requests` headings.
10. Keep bullets complete, active, and client-ready.

## Layout

Scale depth based on account complexity, financing structure, and extent of classification/policy changes over time.

Target length:
- 360-980 words (including schedules and reconciliation view)

Required blocks:
- `Headline position`
- `Balance sheet schedule and composition`
- `Asset analysis`
- `Liability and equity analysis`
- `Reconciliation to source reporting`
- `Comparability implications for diligence analysis`

Scaling rules:
- Keep concise when the balance sheet has stable composition and limited policy/classification changes.
- Expand `Balance sheet schedule and composition` when multiple entities or divisions contribute materially different account profiles.
- Expand `Asset analysis` when receivables, inventory, intangible assets, or related-party balances drive major movement.
- Expand `Liability and equity analysis` when leverage structure, related-party funding, provisions, or deferred balances materially affect interpretation.
- Expand `Reconciliation to source reporting` when trial balance, management, and audited presentations differ.
- Expand `Comparability implications for diligence analysis` when estimate updates or policy applications affect trend interpretation.

Block slot map:
- `Headline position`: 1 `textArray` (1-3 bullets)
- `Balance sheet schedule and composition`: 1 `table` + optional 1 `table` (ratio view) + 1 `text` source note

- Prepaid and other current assets [increased/decreased] by $[x], primarily due to [specific components].
- Property, plant and equipment [increased/decreased] by $[x], driven by [capex, depreciation, disposals], with [collateral/encumbrance fact if relevant].
- Intangible assets [increased/decreased] by $[x], reflecting [acquisition, amortization, or development capitalization policy].

### Liability and equity analysis
- Accounts payable and accruals [increased/decreased] by $[x], primarily due to [vendor payment timing / payroll accrual / one-time items].
- Deferred revenue and other current liabilities [increased/decreased] by $[x], driven by [billing timing / contract liabilities / tax or statutory balances].
- Debt and lease liabilities [increased/decreased] by $[x], with key movements in [facility/lease category], and repayment profile concentrated in [period].
- Related-party funding balances were $[x] as at [Date], with [formal agreement / due-at-call / pricing] characteristics that affect financing interpretation.
- Equity [increased/decreased] by $[x] over the period, primarily due to [profitability/dividend/revaluation/other].

### Reconciliation to source reporting
Source note: [source_note optional]

| Reconciliation area | Status | Key movement | Diligence interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audited financial statements to management balance sheet | [Complete / Partial] | [summary] | [implication] |
| Management balance sheet to trial balance | [Complete / Partial] | [summary] | [implication] |
| Segment/entity to consolidated mapping | [Complete / Partial] | [summary] | [implication] |

- The balance-sheet base used in this section is [audited / management / adjusted], with reconciliation status as shown above.
- [If applicable] Historical system or mapping changes required [manual bridge/reclass], and this affects direct period comparability in [captions].
- [If applicable] Significant reconciling items were concentrated in [captions] and were treated as [classification/period] adjustments.

### Comparability implications for diligence analysis
- [Caption] treatment should be aligned with working capital and net debt definitions to avoid classification drift in purchase-price analysis.
- [Policy or estimate area] may affect period comparability in [specific section], and normalization should apply a consistent basis across periods.
- [If applicable] Related-party and non-trade balances require explicit classification treatment before drawing liquidity or leverage conclusions.
```

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

1. Mistake: repeating high-level P&L commentary without balance-sheet mechanics.
- Fix: focus on caption-level movements and balance-sheet-specific implications.

2. Mistake: listing captions without quantified movement.
- Fix: quantify period changes and state primary component drivers.

3. Mistake: ignoring related-party and non-trade balances.
- Fix: identify and classify these balances explicitly for diligence interpretation.

4. Mistake: discussing financing balances without collateral or repayment context.
- Fix: add key encumbrance and maturity-profile facts where relevant.

5. Mistake: omitting reconciliation between audited, management, and trial-balance views.
- Fix: include a reconciliation-status block and explain interpretation implications.

6. Mistake: creating `Open items` or `Data requests` sections.
- Fix: keep unresolved interpretation inside `Comparability implications for diligence analysis`.

7. Mistake: adding a comments column to schedules.
- Fix: keep schedules numeric and place explanatory detail in narrative bullets.

## Structural preflight rules (must pass)

1. All six required blocks exist and are in this exact order.
2. The schedule includes current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities, equity, and totals.
3. `Total assets` equals `Total liabilities and equity` for each period shown in the full example.
4. `Asset analysis` and `Liability and equity analysis` each include at least three quantified bullets.
5. `Reconciliation to source reporting` includes at least two reconciliation areas and a stated interpretation implication.
6. `Comparability implications for diligence analysis` includes at least two explicit implications tied to diligence interpretation.
7. No `Open items` or `Data requests` headings appear.
8. Missing information is handled with inline placeholders, not unsupported claims.
9. Render skeleton and full example are materially different (template vs worked output).
10. Language and tone pass global conventions.

## Split policy rules

1. Split the balance-sheet schedule into core and supplemental exhibits when row count exceeds readability.
2. Split any bullet longer than 110 words into two tighter bullets.
3. Split `Asset analysis` or `Liability and equity analysis` by caption families when complexity exceeds six bullets.
4. Split reconciliation by entity when one combined bridge obscures material differences.

## Balance sheet

### Headline position
- As at December 31, 2024, total assets were $334.0 million, total liabilities were $229.0 million, and equity was $105.0 million, compared with FY2022 levels of $280.0 million, $195.8 million, and $84.2 million, respectively.
- From FY2022 to FY2024, the largest balance-sheet movements were in trade receivables (+$15.3 million), property and equipment (+$12.8 million), and long-term funding balances (+$11.3 million across debt and lease obligations).
- The balance-sheet profile indicates stronger scale with moderate leverage, while classification consistency between operating and financing captions remains important for purchase-price analysis.

### Asset analysis
- Trade and other receivables increased by $15.3 million from FY2022 to FY2024, primarily due to higher enterprise billing volume and extended settlement timing on two large customer programs.
- Inventory increased by $5.4 million over the same period, reflecting higher safety-stock coverage and expanded product mix; monthly count procedures remained consistent during FY2024.
- Prepaid and other current assets increased by $2.1 million, primarily due to annual software and insurance prepayments.
- Property, plant and equipment increased by $12.8 million, driven by distribution-hub upgrades and technology-enabled equipment additions, net of depreciation.
- Intangible assets increased by $9.7 million, primarily due to platform development capitalization and acquired software modules.

### Liability and equity analysis
- Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $11.2 million from FY2022 to FY2024, mainly due to higher vendor spend and payroll-related accrual growth aligned to operating scale.
- Deferred revenue and other current liabilities increased by $6.2 million, reflecting growth in pre-billed contract activity and related liabilities.
- Total debt and lease obligations increased by $13.4 million from FY2022 to FY2024, with long-term debt funding capex and lease liabilities remaining broadly stable.
- Provisions and other non-current liabilities increased by $2.4 million, primarily due to estimate updates in employee-related obligations and long-term service commitments.
- Equity increased by $20.8 million over the period, driven by cumulative retained earnings growth.

### Reconciliation to source reporting
Source note: Trial-balance to management-reporting bridge files and audited financial statement mapping schedules.

| Reconciliation area | Status | Key movement | Diligence interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audited financial statements to management balance sheet | Complete | No net total variance; minor presentation reclassifications | Reported totals are comparable after classification alignment. |
| Management balance sheet to trial balance | Complete | Small timing movements in accrual and prepaid captions resolved at quarter-end | Interim month movement should be interpreted with period-end true-up context. |
| Segment/entity to consolidated mapping | Partial for one small entity | One entity reports local chart categories requiring mapping | Mapping adjustments are non-structural but must remain consistent across periods. |

- The balance-sheet base in this section uses audited annual statements with management monthly detail mapped to the same presentation basis.
- Reconciliation differences were primarily classification-related and did not create a net variance in total assets or total liabilities and equity.
- One entity-level mapping process remains manual, which requires consistent bridge logic for reliable trend comparison.

### Comparability implications for diligence analysis
- Trade and related non-trade receivables should be classified consistently with working-capital definitions to avoid overstatement of operating current assets.
- Debt, lease, and related financing balances should be aligned to net-debt treatment before final purchase-price bridge conclusions are drawn.
- Period-end accrual and prepaid true-ups should be normalized consistently when comparing quarter or year-end liquidity trends.
- Manual mapping for one entity does not change totals but can affect caption-level trend interpretation if applied inconsistently.
