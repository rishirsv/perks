I started from `context/MANIFEST.md`, which locks the writing targets (style 2B; quality gate 5C) and requires concrete markdown playbook + template drafts with no clarification questions. (`context/MANIFEST.md:L11-L14`). The section corpus is explicitly “verbatim section text” generated from `extracted/cleaned/*.md`. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/README.md:L3-L4`). The corpus (including the QoE section file and the QoE adjustment library) is also validated as verbatim with an overall **pass**, **0 failures**, including `qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md` and `qoe-adjustments-library.md`. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/validation/verbatim-validation-report.md:L3-L24`).

Assumptions I’m proceeding with (explicit, to avoid questions):

- Default metric for this section is **EBITDA**, but the template supports alternates (EBT / pre-tax income / net income to EBITDA bridges) because the corpus includes these patterns. (e.g., net income → EBITDA bridge language appears in the corpus; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2059-L2063`).
- The section must always include a **reported → adjusted bridge** and the bridge must be auditable (basis lines, recurrence labels), even if values are placeholdered; this is a hard QC gate. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md:L128-L136`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L14`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md:L71-L73`).

## 1) Linguistic analysis

Below are section-specific language patterns observed in the verbatim corpus and adjustment library, organized by pattern type and then by “keep / normalize / avoid”.

### A) Sentence length and cadence patterns

Observed patterns (section-specific):

- “Executive lead” cadence in the Overview often uses 1–2 short sentences that state the bridge direction (reported → adjusted) and then a transition like “Significant adjustments are discussed…” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L18-L20`).
- Adjustment rationales typically follow a 2-step cadence:
  1. **Headline sentence** naming the adjustment and action verb (“This adjustment removes… / reflects… / eliminates… / reverses…”) (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L35-L38`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L54-L55`).
  2. **Support sentence(s)** giving period-specific facts, quantification method, and/or basis (“We obtained invoices… no discrepancies noted.”) (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L38-L38`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L54-L54`).

- Long, multi-clause sentences appear when the rationale includes (i) background, (ii) chronology, and (iii) accounting treatment; they are defensible but need normalization to meet house readability standards (use headings/bullets; keep “so what” early). (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L78-L81`)

Keep as-is patterns:

- Lead with the “bridge delta” sentence when numbers exist (“reported EBITDA of $X increases/decreases to $Y after adjustments”). This is both client-readable and ties directly to the bridge exhibit. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L18-L18`)
- Use “This adjustment [verb] …” as the standard headline for each adjustment rationale (high signal; common across corpus). (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L35-L35`)

Normalize/clean patterns:

- Break long adjustment rationales into a short headline + bullets for: (i) recurrence logic, (ii) quantification method, (iii) basis reviewed, (iv) residual risk. This aligns with the explicit defensibility checklist for adjustments. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L47-L54`)
- Replace “table below / adjacent table / following pages” with “Exhibit [#]” so references remain correct after formatting changes (DOCX conversion, exhibit reordering). The corpus uses “table below/adjacent” frequently; the house standard is exhibit discipline (title/period/units/source). (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md:L17-L33`)

Avoid patterns:

- “Not present in source report” as narrative content. This appears as a corpus extraction artifact and is not client-ready; in the skill output it should become an open item or be omitted. (Phrase occurs in the corpus; e.g., `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L63-L63`.)
- Copy/paste duplication artifacts (e.g., repeated clause around punctuation / colon duplication) that can occur in redacted/simulated entries; these need lint detection (see failure modes).

### B) Hedge vs certainty phrasing patterns

Observed patterns:

- Management attribution: “Management represents that…”, “Management informed us…”, “According to Management…” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L40-L41`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L57-L57`)
- Practitioner hedge: “We understand that…”, often paired with “Based on discussions…” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L35-L36`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L46-L46`)
- Practitioner certainty via evidence: “We obtained supporting invoices… no discrepancies noted.” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L38-L38`)
- Practitioner judgment language: “we view these costs as recurring” used to reverse a management add-back (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L55-L55`)

Keep as-is patterns:

- Use explicit attribution whenever the basis is management-provided (“Management represents…”). This is directly aligned with “explicit about uncertainty” and “facts vs judgments” standards. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L19-L36`)
- Use evidence-forward phrasing when support exists (“We obtained… no discrepancies noted.”). This is the strongest defensibility signal in the corpus. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L38-L38`)

Normalize/clean patterns:

- Standardize to a small, consistent set of hedge labels:
  - “Source: Management” (for unverified)
  - “Based on [evidence]” (for verified)
  - “We have treated…” (for judgment + rationale)
    This aligns with the basis conventions requirement for material quantitative claims. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L37-L45`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md:L71-L73`)

- When using “we view / we consider”, add the minimum defensibility quartet: what / why / how quantified / residual risk. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L47-L54`)

Avoid patterns:

- Unqualified absolutes (e.g., “fully normalized”, “no risk”). House standards explicitly warn against unqualified absolutes without clear evidence. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L22-L26`)
- Softening language that minimizes risk; QC explicitly flags “red flags minimized”. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L12-L13`)

### C) Transition logic patterns

Observed patterns:

- Logic connectors and sequencing are heavily used: “As a result…”, “Therefore…”, “However…”, “In order to…”, “Going forward…” across Overview and adjustment rationales. (Common throughout corpus; e.g., “As a result” and “However” appear repeatedly; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L903-L903`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L68-L68`.)
- Cross-references: “Refer to Appendix…”, “See…”, used to anchor details. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L48-L48`)

Keep as-is patterns:

- Use “As a result” to connect transaction perimeter / definitional assumptions to bridge impacts (common and intuitive). (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L903-L903`)
- Use “Refer to Appendix/Exhibit” for traceability.

Normalize/clean patterns:

- Prefer 1 connector per sentence; avoid stacking multiple (“However… therefore… as a result…”) in one line.
- Replace “the following page(s)” with exhibit references to avoid doc-assembly errors.

Avoid patterns:

- Transitions that imply certainty without basis (“Therefore it will not recur…”) unless you have the evidence line. House rules require explicit uncertainty labeling. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L19-L36`)

### D) Quantification phrase patterns

Observed patterns (high-value to preserve):

- “approximately $X”, “implies an annual salary of $X”, “ranging from $X to $Y”, “based on [period] expenses incurred”, “annualizing [month] amount”, “per annum” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L48-L48`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L54-L54`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2270-L2270`)
- Basis-tied quantification: “based on expenses incurred over the historical period” is a recurring pattern that aligns with house standards. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L54-L54`)

Keep as-is patterns:

- Always attach period to quantified statements (“FYxx”, “LTM”, “TTM”). Consistency rules explicitly require it. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L56-L64`)
- Keep “based on [source] / [period]” quantification framing.

Normalize/clean patterns:

- Enforce consistent units and sign conventions (parentheses for negatives), and label units in the exhibit caption/units row. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L56-L60`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md:L34-L39`)
- Replace vague “significant” with quantified impact where available; otherwise label as qualitative and put quantification into open items. (House tone and QC dimensions both push this direction.) (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L19-L21`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L33-L41`)

Avoid patterns:

- Unlabeled placeholders (“EBITDA was $X”) are explicitly a “do not deliver” QC failure. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L13`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md:L71-L71`)

### E) Caveat / disclaimer patterns

Observed patterns (common + important for defensibility):

- Non-all-inclusiveness / information-to-date disclaimer: “not necessarily all-inclusive… based on information provided by Management to date… further analysis… could uncover additional…” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L30-L30`)
- “Not included because subjective / not quantifiable” framing for “Other considerations”. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L70-L70`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2048-L2048`)
- Explicit limitation: “We did not obtain monthly financial statements… figures… based on annual statements.” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L57-L59`)
- Explicit decision not to adjust + reason: “We have not sought to adjust… due to [reason]… may present a small risk…” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2270-L2270`)

Keep as-is patterns:

- Keep the “not all-inclusive / information-to-date” disclaimer, but link it to the open-items list so it’s actionable. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L30-L30`)
- Keep “subjective / not quantifiable → not included” as explicit guardrails between the bridge and “other considerations”. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L70-L70`)

Normalize/clean patterns:

- Convert generic disclaimers into specific open items (“Missing: monthly financials for [period]; impact could change revenue cut-off adjustment.”) consistent with open-items discipline. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L65-L73`)
- Prefer “We have not adjusted…” over “not present” to reflect analyst choice and defensibility.

Avoid patterns:

- Blanket disclaimers that substitute for doing the bridge work. QC requires the bridge regardless. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L10`)

## 2) Structural analysis

### Dominant internal structure variants in corpus entries

Across the verbatim corpus, the section consistently breaks into three internal blocks:

1. `## Overview`
2. `## Quality of earnings adjustments`
3. `## Other considerations`

This pattern appears for each report entry inside `qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md` (23 entries per corpus README and validation). (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/README.md:L13-L20`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/validation/verbatim-validation-report.md:L3-L24`)

Within `## Quality of earnings adjustments`, there are notable variants:

Variant A: “Management adjustments” + “Potential adjustments” (sometimes plus “Pro forma adjustments”)

- Example language explicitly labels management-identified items and diligence-identified items. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L33-L56`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L115-L119`)

Variant B: Itemized adjustment list (numbered), sometimes referencing sell-side / diligence adjustment numbers

- Common in later entries: “1. [Adjustment]: … 2. [Adjustment]: …” with embedded recurrence and quantification comments. (e.g., `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L1972-L1988`)

Variant C: Definitional bridge before earnings normalization (net income → reported EBITDA), then adjustments

- Appears at least once as an explicit “Net income to reported EBITDA” bridge narrative. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2059-L2063`)
- There is also a distinct “## Definitional adjustments” block in the corpus. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L516-L516`)

Variant D: “Other considerations” explicitly separated as subjective / not quantifiable and excluded from the bridge

- This is repeated in multiple entries and is a key defensibility boundary. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L70-L70`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L2048-L2048`)

### Recommended default structure (house-standardized 2B)

Default structure should be driven by the “minimum content” requirements for this canonical section: bridge, basis, recurrence commentary, open items. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md:L128-L136`)

Recommended default (canonical block order):

1. Key takeaway (1–2 sentences; state reported → adjusted and main drivers)
2. Exhibit: Reported → Adjusted bridge table (primary exhibit; auditable)
3. Adjustment rationale by type (grouped; each adjustment uses defensibility quartet)
4. Other considerations not included in adjusted earnings (explicitly excluded; why)
5. Sensitivities and open items that could change the bridge (prioritized P0/P1/P2)

Allowed variants (explicitly permitted):

- Variant A sub-structure inside #3: split into “Management adjustments” and “Diligence adjustments” when a management adjustment schedule exists and it’s helpful to show what we accepted vs challenged.
- Variant C optional add-on: “Definitional bridge (net income → reported EBITDA)” as an exhibit or short subsection when the EBITDA definition is non-standard or contentious.
- Metric variant: If the engagement uses EBT/pre-tax income (seen in corpus), the bridge headers and narrative should switch metric labels but keep the same auditability requirements.

### Required vs optional sub-blocks

Required (must always be present in skill output):

- Key takeaway (even if placeholdered)
- Reported → Adjusted bridge exhibit (even if “TBD” values, but structure must exist)
- Recurrence framing for each material adjustment (non-recurring vs run-rate vs recurring/uncertain)
- Basis/source for each material adjustment, or explicit open item if missing
- Open items list specific to items that could change the bridge

These are hard-gated by report-structure minimums and QC “do not deliver” checks. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md:L128-L136`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L13`)

Optional:

- Definitional adjustments bridge (net income → reported EBITDA)
- Other considerations (if there are items not quantified / subjective; otherwise can be omitted)
- Pro forma adjustments sub-block (only if explicitly in-scope; otherwise keep them in the Pro forma section per the canonical structure)

---

## 3) Failure-mode analysis

Below are the top generation failure modes for this section, with detection heuristics and prevention controls you can implement as prompt rules, lint checks, and template constraints.

### Failure mode 1: Missing bridge or bridge doesn’t tie

Why it happens:

- Model produces narrative without the reconciliation table, or produces a table without totals that tie.

Detection heuristics:

- Section contains “QoE and earnings adjustments” but no bridge table with “Reported” and “Adjusted”.
- If numeric values exist: reported + sum(adjustments) ≠ adjusted.
- Missing “Source:” line under the exhibit.

Prevention controls:

- Template constraint: require a bridge table block; do not allow completion without it.
- Lint check: fail if bridge table header absent; fail if tie-out mismatch when all numeric cells are present.
- Prompt rule: “QoE section is invalid without a reported-to-adjusted bridge.”

Hard evidence for gate:

- QC checklist explicitly blocks delivery if QoE section has no bridge or doesn’t sum. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L10`)
- Report-structure minimum content requires the bridge. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md:L131-L136`)

### Failure mode 2: Adjustments lack basis/source (or basis is implied but not stated)

Detection heuristics:

- Adjustment rows missing “Basis” field, or narrative lacks any “Source:”/“Based on…” lines.
- Quantitative claim without basis line.

Prevention controls:

- Template: every adjustment row includes a “Basis” column (required, can be “Open item”).
- Lint: if “Impact” is numeric and “Basis” is blank → fail.
- Prompt rule: “For every material quantitative claim, include a basis/source or mark as open item.”

Evidence:

- Writing standards require basis conventions and explicit sourcing for quantitative claims. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L37-L45`)
- SKILL.md critical rule repeats this. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md:L71-L73`)
- QC checklist treats missing basis as “do not deliver.” (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L10-L11`)

### Failure mode 3: Recurrence mis-framing (calling recurring items “non-recurring” without justification)

Detection heuristics:

- Adjustment labeled “non-recurring” but rationale doesn’t explain why it won’t recur.
- Reversal of management add-back not explained (“we view as recurring”) without citing evidence (periodicity, consistency).

Prevention controls:

- Micro-template per adjustment must include “Why non-recurring/run-rate” and “Residual risk”.
- Lint: each adjustment must have Recurrence = one of {Non-recurring, Run-rate, Recurring, Uncertain}; if missing → fail.
- Prompt rule: “If recurrence is uncertain, label it Uncertain and move to open items / sensitivity.”

Evidence:

- Defensibility rules for adjustments explicitly require why and residual risk. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L47-L54`)
- Corpus shows both sides (accepting and reversing management add-backs) and frames it explicitly. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L54-L55`)

### Failure mode 4: Period/unit inconsistency across bridge, narrative, and exhibits

Detection heuristics:

- Multiple units used ($m vs $k) without note; FY vs LTM mixed without explanation.
- Bridge caption missing period and units.

Prevention controls:

- Template requires “Period covered” and “Units” in the exhibit caption (or units row).
- Lint: fail if bridge caption missing period or units.
- Prompt rule: “Use one unit convention consistently; note if an exhibit differs.”

Evidence:

- Writing standards require period and unit consistency. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L56-L64`)
- QC checklist blocks delivery for inconsistent units/periods. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L10-L12`)
- Exhibit minimums require period/units/source for every exhibit. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md:L17-L33`)

### Failure mode 5: Invented numbers or unlabeled placeholders

Detection heuristics:

- Presence of numbers not tied to any stated source/basis.
- Placeholders like “$X” appear without being labeled as placeholder/open item.
- Narrative claims “EBITDA was $X” without source.

Prevention controls:

- Prompt rule: never invent numbers; use `$[x]` and add an open item.
- Lint: fail if pattern “$X” or “[DATE]” appears in final output unless inside an explicit placeholder token or open-item list.
- Template: explicitly include placeholder syntax and an “Open items” block.

Evidence:

- SKILL.md critical rule: do not invent numbers; use placeholders like `$[x]`. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md:L71-L71`)
- QC checklist blocks delivery if invented placeholders are unlabeled. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md:L8-L12`)

### Failure mode 6: Blurring “included adjustments” vs “other considerations”

Detection heuristics:

- Items described as subjective/non-quantifiable appear in the bridge table.
- Other considerations list lacks explicit “not included” language.

Prevention controls:

- Template separation: “Other considerations (not included in adjusted EBITDA)” is its own block.
- Lint: fail if “subjective” or “not quantifiable” appears in an adjustment row with numeric impact.

Evidence:

- Corpus consistently separates subjective items and states they are not included. (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/qoe-and-earnings-adjustments.md:L70-L70`)
- Writing standards emphasize credibility and not inventing. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L7-L16`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md:L37-L45`)

## 4) Draft markdown playbook (implementable)

```markdown
# QoE and earnings adjustments — playbook (Style 2B, Quality gate 5C)

## Objective

Reconcile reported earnings to a normalized, decision-useful measure (default: EBITDA) using a defensible reported → adjusted bridge, with clear recurrence framing and explicit basis for each material adjustment.

Minimum content required for this canonical section:

- A clear bridge: Reported → Adjustments (by type) → Adjusted
- Evidence/basis for each material adjustment
- Commentary on recurrence and sustainability
- A list of open items that could change the bridge
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md`)

## Required inputs (use what is available; do not block)

Preferred inputs:

- Income statement and/or monthly management accounts for the historical period (FY / LTM / TTM)
- Trial balance and/or GL extracts (if available)
- Management adjustment schedule (if available)
- Supporting detail for major one-time items (invoices, contracts, settlement agreements, payroll detail)
- Revenue detail where revenue recognition/cut-off is a risk (customer/LOB, credit notes, deferred revenue)

If an input is missing:

- Do not invent numbers.
- Use placeholders ($[x], [period], [date]) and add a prioritized open item.
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md`; `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`)

## Canonical block order (default output structure)

1. Key takeaway (1–2 sentences)
2. Exhibit: Reported → Adjusted [metric] bridge (primary exhibit)
3. Adjustment rationale by type (narrative; grouped; defensibility micro-template)
4. Other considerations (not included in adjusted [metric]) — optional but common
5. Key sensitivities and open items that could change the bridge (prioritized)

Allowed variants:

- If management provided an adjustment schedule: sub-split the narrative into (i) Management adjustments, (ii) Diligence adjustments (accepted/challenged), while still presenting one unified bridge.
- If EBITDA definition is non-standard: include an optional “Definitional bridge (net income → reported EBITDA)” exhibit.
- If the engagement uses EBT/pre-tax income: replace “EBITDA” labels with the correct metric consistently.

## Exhibit rules (bridge must be auditable)

Bridge exhibit must include:

- Period covered
- Units
- Source/basis line
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`)

Preferred bridge table structure:

| Adjustment type | Description | Period | Impact ($) | Recurring? | Basis |
| --------------- | ----------- | -----: | ---------: | ---------- | ----- |

Rules:

- Keep descriptions short in the table; put detailed rationale in the narrative.
- Every numeric impact must have a basis; if basis is not available, label the basis as an open item.
- Use consistent units and sign convention (negatives in parentheses).
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`; `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`)

## Adjustment narrative — defensibility micro-template (required per material adjustment)

For each material adjustment included in the bridge, include:

1. What it is (plain-English description)
2. Why it is treated as non-recurring / run-rate / recurring (recurrence framing)
3. How it was quantified (data used, period, key assumptions)
4. Basis reviewed (what evidence supports it)
5. Residual risk / sensitivity (what could change the conclusion)

(Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`)

### Standard action verbs (preferred)

Use consistent “headline sentence” verbs (choose one):

- “This adjustment removes …”
- “This adjustment adds back …”
- “This adjustment reflects …”
- “This adjustment re-allocates … to the appropriate period …”
- “This adjustment reverses Management’s add-back … because …”

### Standard recurrence labels (use one per adjustment)

- Non-recurring: not expected to recur; one-time or isolated event
- Run-rate: reflects expected go-forward cost/revenue base (normalized level)
- Recurring: ongoing normal course; not appropriate to adjust out
- Uncertain: recurrence cannot be concluded with evidence available; treat as sensitivity / open item

## Evidence and basis conventions (must follow)

- Distinguish facts vs judgments explicitly.
- For material quantitative claims, provide a basis line (source and date if known).
- If the basis is not available, do not invent numbers; log an open item.
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`; `skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md`)

Preferred basis phrasing:

- “Source: trial balance extract dated [YYYY-MM-DD].”
- “Source: management adjustment schedule; not audited.”
- “Source: invoices provided by management; we noted no exceptions in the sample reviewed.”
- “Source: [contract / settlement agreement] dated [YYYY-MM-DD].”

## Open items behavior (when data is missing or conclusion is not defensible)

Always maintain an “Open items & sensitivities” list that is specific to this section and prioritized:

- P0 = gating items that could materially change adjusted earnings
- P1 = important refinements
- P2 = informational / confirmatory

When an adjustment cannot be supported:

- Do not include it in the bridge unless explicitly labeled as “indicative” and paired with a P0/P1 open item.
- Alternatively, move it to “Other considerations (not included)” and explain why.

## Style rules (2B: corpus-inspired + house-standardized)

Write to be client-ready and easy to review:

- Put the “so what” in the first 1–2 sentences of the section and each major subsection.
- Use short paragraphs and bullets; avoid long unstructured blocks.
- Use explicit attribution for management-provided claims (“Management represents…”, “We understand…”) and pair with basis wherever possible.
- Avoid casual language and unqualified absolutes.
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`)

Preferred cross-references:

- Use “Exhibit [#]” / “Appendix [#]” rather than “table below” or “following page(s)”.

## QA checks and pass/fail gates (5C)

PASS requires all of the following:

- Bridge table is present and readable (Reported → Adjustments → Adjusted)
- Bridge ties out where numbers exist; otherwise the tie-out is explicitly marked as pending with open items
- Every material adjustment has: recurrence label + basis/source + quantification method (or explicit open item)
- Units and periods are consistent throughout the section
- No invented numbers; placeholders are clearly labeled and logged as open items
- “Other considerations” items are explicitly stated as not included in adjusted earnings (if applicable)

FAIL if any of the “do not deliver” QC issues occur:

- QoE section present but no reported-to-adjusted bridge (or bridge does not sum)
- Material quantitative claims have no basis/source and are not flagged as open items
- Units/periods inconsistent
- Invented placeholders not labeled
  (Ref: `skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`)

## Suggested lint checks (implementable)

1. Bridge presence:

- Must contain a bridge table with the header “Adjustment type | Description | Period | Impact | Recurring? | Basis”

2. Basis completeness:

- For each adjustment row with a numeric impact, “Basis” must be non-empty OR contain “Open item”

3. Recurrence completeness:

- Each adjustment row must contain Recurring? in {Non-recurring, Run-rate, Recurring, Uncertain}

4. Placeholder discipline:

- Reject tokens like “EBITDA was $X” unless $X is formatted as $[x] and appears in Open items

5. Cross-reference hygiene:

- Reject “table below / adjacent table / following pages” (replace with Exhibit references)

6. Other-considerations separation:

- If “subjective” or “not quantifiable” appears, ensure the item is not included in the bridge table

## 5) Draft markdown template (implementable)

```markdown
# QoE and earnings adjustments

## Key takeaway

- Reported [EBITDA/EBT] of $[x] for [period] adjusts to $[x] after net adjustments of $[x]. The bridge is primarily driven by: (i) [Adjustment 1], (ii) [Adjustment 2], and (iii) [Adjustment 3].  
  Source: [management accounts / audited FS / TB extract]; see Exhibit [#].

If reported / adjusted values are not available:

- A reported-to-adjusted bridge is pending receipt of [missing inputs]. We have outlined the adjustment areas identified to date and the open items required to quantify and validate each item.

## Exhibit [#]: Reported to Adjusted [EBITDA/EBT] bridge ([period], $[units])

Source: [management adjustment schedule / TB extract / audited FS]; basis notes per line item.

| Adjustment type      | Description           |   Period | Impact ($) | Recurring?    | Basis                                                                   |

Notes:

- Units/sign convention: [e.g., $m; negatives in parentheses].
- Definition: [what is included in EBITDA/EBT for this bridge; note any differences vs other exhibits].

## Adjustment rationale (grouped; required for material items)

### Non-recurring items

#### [Adjustment name]

- What it is: [plain-English description]
- Recurrence framing: We have treated this as non-recurring because [reason].  
  If management-provided: Management represents that [statement] (not independently verified unless noted).
- Quantification: $[x] based on [data] for [period]; assumptions: [key assumptions].
- Basis reviewed: [TB/GL extract, invoice, contract, settlement agreement, etc.]; [verification status].
- Residual risk / sensitivity: [what could change the conclusion; what remains to validate].

### Run-rate normalization

#### [Adjustment name]

- What it is:
- Recurrence framing:
- Quantification:
- Basis reviewed:
- Residual risk / sensitivity:

### Owner / related-party and discretionary items (if applicable)

#### [Adjustment name]

- What it is:
- Recurrence framing:
- Quantification:
- Basis reviewed:
- Residual risk / sensitivity:

### Accounting / classification / out-of-period (if applicable)

#### [Adjustment name]

- What it is:
- Recurrence framing:
- Quantification:
- Basis reviewed:
- Residual risk / sensitivity:

## Other considerations (not included in adjusted [EBITDA/EBT])

List items identified that may be subjective and/or not quantifiable at this stage and therefore are not reflected in the bridge.

- [Item]: [why it matters], [why not adjusted], [what would be needed to quantify], [potential directional impact if known].

## Key sensitivities and open items (could change the bridge)

Prioritize open items as P0/P1/P2.

- **P0 (gating):** [open item] — Impact: [potentially material / unknown]; Needed: [specific data]; Affects: [bridge line item].
- **P1:** [open item] — Impact: [likely moderate]; Needed: [data].
- **P2:** [open item] — Impact: [informational]; Needed: [data].
```

This template enforces the section minimums (bridge, basis, recurrence, open items) and is consistent with the exhibit requirements and the “do not deliver if” QC gates.

If you want to implement this immediately in the skill repository, the lowest-friction path is:

- Replace or supersede `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/qoe-adjustments.md` with the template above (it’s a strict superset of the current template’s intent). (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/qoe-adjustments.md:L1-L38`)
- Add the playbook as a section-specific writing asset alongside the existing QoE playbook (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/analysis-playbooks/qoe-playbook.md`) or expand that file with the “defensibility micro-template” and “lint checks” blocks. (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/analysis-playbooks/qoe-playbook.md:L1-L36`)
