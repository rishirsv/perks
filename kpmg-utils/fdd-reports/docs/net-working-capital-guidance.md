Assumptions (explicit, to proceed without questions): “Style 2B” means we preserve the Working capital corpus’ cadence and idioms while standardizing to house defensibility rules in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md` and polish gates in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`. “Quality gate 5C” means the section is client-ready and defensible under those same house standards, including “do not deliver if” conditions. These assumptions align with the task constraints in `context/MANIFEST.md`.

1. Linguistic analysis (section-specific patterns)

Sentence length / cadence patterns (what the corpus actually does)

- Typical cadence is 2–4 sentence paragraphs in the “Overview”, followed by dense enumerated adjustment lines. This is consistent across entries in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md` (e.g., “Overview” blocks for project-ascend, project-autobahn, project-panacea).
- Quant-heavy sentences are common and usually sit early: “Average … is $X (FYyy: $Y) …” and “As at [date] …” (e.g., project-ascend and project-skyrocket overviews in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- Adjustment descriptions often follow a two-beat structure: (1) what it is; (2) what it does (“This adjustment …”) (e.g., accrued revenue / payroll in project-ascend; multiple items in project-west; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md` and echoed in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/adjustments/working-capital-adjustments-library.md`).

Hedge / certainty phrasing patterns
Keep as-is patterns (defensible + corpus-consistent)

- Management-sourcing and partial-scope hedges:
  - “based on information provided by Management to date” and “could uncover additional… adjustments” (project-ascend “Overview”, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
  - “It is our understanding…” for deal mechanics that will change post-close (private jet example “Since this arrangement will cease upon closing…”, project-autobahn, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

- Conditionality when assumptions are necessary:
  - “we have assumed…” and “estimated…” language appears in adjustment quantification (e.g., severance timing assumption; DSO/DPO-based estimates; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Normalize / clean patterns (keep meaning, fix house style + auditability)

- Consolidate repeated “not all-inclusive / further investigation” caveats into one standardized sentence and move it to a consistent place (end of Overview), instead of repeating it mid-flow:
  - Variants appear in project-ascend (“not necessarily all-inclusive… Further analysis… could uncover…”) and project-panacea (“not deemed to be all inclusive… may require further investigation…”) in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.

- Replace “adjacent table / table below / schedule opposite” with explicit exhibit references (“Exhibit WC-1…”) because markdown is not spatial (examples: “The adjacent table…” in project-panacea; “schedule opposite” in project-skyrocket; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- Replace direct second-person (“your offer letter”, “for your consideration”) with report-voice neutral framing:
  - “We understand that your offer letter defined…” (UK offer-letter passage, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Avoid patterns (must not propagate into generated client drafts)

- “Not present in source report” filler lines (numerous in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md` and the adjustments library). These are extraction artifacts and fail client-ready quality.
- Ellipses truncation (“…”) as seen in project-vortex simulated entry (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`). Treat as corrupted text; never reproduce.
- Placeholder tokens and malformed dates/currencies (e.g., “[ENTITY]”, “DD MM 20X3”, “££”) present in some entries (notably education and consumer-retail extracts) in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/adjustments/working-capital-adjustments-library.md` and `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.
- Duplicated lines from extraction (e.g., repeated sentences in project-dental adjustments within both the section corpus and adjustment library). These must be deduped before delivery (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/adjustments/working-capital-adjustments-library.md`).

Transition logic patterns (how “so what” is carried)
Keep as-is patterns

- Cause → driver phrasing: “due to… driven by… primarily…” and “offset by…” is the dominant causal style (e.g., project-autobahn decline drivers; project-y offer-letter passage; project-z factoring impacts; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- “On this basis…” used for target/peg comparison conclusions (project-y “deficit compared to target”; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Normalize patterns

- Ensure every causal sentence ties to a defined metric (NWC $ amount, % of revenue, or days) and period. Some entries mix drivers without anchoring the metric in the same paragraph; the template should force the metric first (house “so what first” rule in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`).

Quantification phrase patterns
Keep as-is patterns

- Period anchoring: “FYxx”, “TTM”, “LTM”, “as at [date]” are consistent anchors (multiple entries in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- Comparative parentheticals: “FY24 (FY23: …)” appears in stronger drafts (e.g., project-skyrocket; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- Working-capital-days triad: DSO/DIO/DPO appears as a standard operational lens (e.g., project-dental “Days Analysis”; and multiple adjustment quantifications via DSO/DPO; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Normalize patterns

- Standardize sign conventions and add units consistently (house consistency rules in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md` and exhibit minimums in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`).

Caveat / disclaimer patterns (normalization caveats)
Keep as-is patterns (but standardize placement)

- “Not all-inclusive; based on Management; further analysis may change adjustments” (project-ascend; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- “Validity… may require further investigation… impact on valuation model” (project-panacea; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- Data availability caveats: “audited statements not broken out in sufficient detail” (project-autobahn; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`) and “not publicly available” for cash / lease breakdowns (project-dental; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

2. Structural analysis (dominant variants → recommended default)

Dominant internal structure variants seen in corpus entries (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`)
Variant A (most common, “2-block”)

- Overview (2–6 sentences) → Net working capital adjustments (numbered list)

Variant B (adds definitional/context sub-blocks)

- Overview → “Basis of preparation/presentation” (or similar) → Adjustments list
  - Example: project-west includes “Basis of preparation” language plus component descriptions (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Variant C (adds operational lens)

- Overview includes DSO/DIO/DPO seasonality commentary → Adjustments list
  - Example: project-dental “Days Analysis” narrative (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Variant D (explicit target/peg comparison)

- Overview includes a stated/derived target and surplus/deficit conclusion → Adjustments list
  - Examples: offer-letter target basis and derived target method; project-y “6+6 target… deficit compared to target” (`context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Recommended default structure (for the skill)
Rationale: aligns with minimum content expectations for Working capital in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md` (definition + normalized vs actual + seasonality/volatility if evidenced + implications), and with the current template’s intent to start with definition and then implications (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`).

Default block order (canonical)

1. Key takeaway (1–2 sentences, metric first)
2. Working capital definition (table: included/excluded + rationale)
3. Historical behavior (trend/seasonality; days metrics if available)
4. Normalization (reported → definitional → diligence → pro forma; show normalized range if possible)
5. Peg / target and implications (only if deal definition/target exists; otherwise explicitly open-item it)
6. Open items & data requests (P0/P1/P2)

Allowed variants (explicit)

- Data-light variant: If only one period-end snapshot is available, keep blocks 1–2, then provide a “snapshot-only limitation” caveat and move directly to open items (consistent with “period-end snapshots with caveats” guidance in the template: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`).
- Sell-side/buy-side variant: If sell-side diligence exists, include a short “what we relied on vs what we changed” sub-block before normalization (pattern used in project-panacea and project-skyrocket language in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Required vs optional sub-blocks
Required

- Definition table (explicitly called for in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md` and `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`)
- Normalized vs actual (or explicit “cannot normalize because…” with data requests) (required by `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md`)
- Implications (peg risk / cash impact, clearly labeled) (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md`)
- Open items list (house standard: keep a running open-items view; `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`)

Optional (only when supported)

- DSO/DIO/DPO “days” analysis and seasonality commentary (when data exists; matches corpus examples like project-dental and project-groundworks in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`)
- Target methodology discussion (only when deal doc defines target basis or forecasts exist; see offer-letter passage in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`)

3. Failure-mode analysis (generation risks → heuristics → controls)

Failure mode 1: Missing or ambiguous WC definition (operating vs total; inclusions/exclusions unclear)

- Detect: no “Definition” block/table; or “working capital” used without “included/excluded” list.
- Prevent:
  - Template constraint: definition table is mandatory and must include “Included”, “Excluded”, and “Rationale” columns (per `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md` and `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`).
  - Lint: fail if no markdown table exists under “Working capital definition”.

Failure mode 2: “Adjacency” references that don’t work in markdown (“adjacent table”, “schedule opposite”)

- Detect: regex hits for “adjacent”, “opposite”, “table below” in narrative.
- Prevent:
  - Prompt rule: always refer to “Exhibit WC-[#]”.
  - Lint: fail on `\badjacent\b|\bopposite\b|\btable below\b` (corpus contains these phrases: project-panacea and project-skyrocket; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Failure mode 3: Normalization claimed without caveats or basis (over-certainty)

- Detect: words like “normalized” or “target” without a “Basis:” line or without any “management-provided / not audited” qualifier where applicable.
- Prevent:
  - Template constraint: any normalized figure must have an explicit “Basis:” line (house sourcing rules in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`).
  - QC gate: “Material quantitative claims have no basis/source…” is do-not-deliver (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`).

Failure mode 4: Seasonality ignored (single point estimate presented as “target”)

- Detect: target stated but no mention of “average”/period basis, or no discussion of monthly/quarterly trend when available.
- Prevent:
  - Prompt rule: if only period-end data, must include snapshot limitation caveat (current template warns against single point estimate without seasonality acknowledgement: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`).
  - Lint: if “target” present, require “average” or explicit basis phrase (e.g., “12 months prior to completion”) (offer-letter passage shows this basis language: `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).

Failure mode 5: Peg/target implications stated as fact when target not provided

- Detect: “deficit/excess vs target” language without target value and source.
- Prevent:
  - Template constraint: Peg/Target sub-block must start with “Deal definition / source: …” and if missing, convert to P0 open item.

Failure mode 6: Extraction artifacts leak into client deliverable

- Detect: “Not present in source report”, “[ENTITY]”, “DD MM 20X”, “££”, or “...” present.
- Prevent:
  - Hard lint fail on these tokens (they are present in the corpus and adjustment library and should never appear in generated drafts: `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`, `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/adjustments/working-capital-adjustments-library.md`).

Failure mode 7: Adjustments list reads like a data dump (no “what / why / so what / residual risk”)

- Detect: adjustments listed without rationale or without stating whether it’s definitional vs diligence vs pro forma.
- Prevent:
  - Template constraint: adjustments table requires columns for “Type”, “Description”, “Impact”, “Basis”, “Residual risk” (aligned with exhibit standards and defensibility rules: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`, `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`).

Failure mode 8: Numbers/units/periods inconsistent inside the section

- Detect: mixed $m/$k, FY vs TTM without explicit labeling.
- Prevent:
  - QC gate: “Units and periods are inconsistent…” is do-not-deliver (`context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`).
  - Lint: require a “Period:” and “Units:” line in each exhibit caption (exhibit minimums: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`).

Failure mode 9: Red flags minimized (tone drift)

- Detect: strong positive language without noting caveats where evidence is management-only or unaudited.
- Prevent:
  - Prompt rule: any management-only inputs must be labeled as such (tone + uncertainty guidance: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`).

Failure mode 10: Missing open items despite acknowledged data gaps

- Detect: “not available / not publicly available / insufficient detail” appears but no open items list.
- Prevent:
  - Template constraint: “Open items & data requests” is mandatory, and any “not available” phrase must generate at least one P0/P1 item (open items guidance in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md` and QC requirement in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`).

4. Draft markdown playbook (implementable)

```markdown
# Working capital — Draft Playbook (Style 2B / Quality gate 5C)

## Objective

Assess normalized working capital and implications for cash flow, peg/target, and close mechanics.
(Ref: section objective and minimum content in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/report-structure.md` and section intent in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`.)

## Required inputs (minimum)

P0 (gates normalization / peg linkage)

- Deal working capital definition (SPA / term sheet / offer letter): included/excluded accounts; treatment of cash/debt-like items; target basis (e.g., 12-month average).
- Monthly or quarterly balance sheet detail for WC accounts across the analysis period.

P1 (improves defensibility and driver analysis)

- Trial balance / GL detail for WC accounts (for tie-outs and adjustments).
- AR aging and credit notes / rebates detail (if AR is in scope).
- AP aging (including capex payables separation if relevant).
- Inventory detail and obsolescence / reserves (if inventory is in scope).
- Deferred revenue / customer deposits detail (if applicable).

P2 (context)

- Seasonality narrative from management (must be labeled as management-provided).
- Any sell-side diligence WC schedule and adjustment list (if available).

(Ref input expectations in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/analysis-playbooks/working-capital-playbook.md`.)

## Canonical block order (must follow)

1. Key takeaway (1–2 sentences, metric + implication)
2. Working capital definition (table)
3. Historical behavior (trend/seasonality + key drivers)
4. Normalized vs actual (including definitional / diligence / pro forma adjustments)
5. Peg/target and implications (conditional on deal definition)
6. Open items & data requests (P0/P1/P2)

## Evidence / basis rules (5C gate)

- Do not invent numbers. If missing, use placeholders like `$[x]`, `[Period]`, `[Date]` and convert conclusions to open items.
  (Ref: “Do not invent numbers” in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/SKILL.md` and sourcing rules in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`.)
- Every exhibit must include: title, period, units, and a Source/Basis line.
  (Ref: `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/exhibits-and-tables.md`.)
- Any statement that depends on management representation must be labeled (“Management indicated…”, “Management provided…”).
  (Ref: tone and uncertainty rules in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`.)
- Normalization caveat must appear once, consistently, at end of Overview:
  Standard caveat (use verbatim meaning, standardized):
  “Potential adjustments reflect information provided by management to date and may not be all-inclusive; additional procedures and access to supporting data could result in changes.”
  (Corpus basis: project-ascend and project-panacea overview caveats in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)

## Working capital definition — required table language

- Use a 3-column table: Included / Excluded / Rationale.
- Rationale must explicitly label exclusions as one of: debt-like, non-operational, capex-related, non-recurring, non-trade/non-current, presentation-only.
  (Corpus examples include debt-like exclusions such as accrued interest and lease liabilities, and non-operating cash treatment; see project-panacea and project-dental in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)

## Normalization approach (required)

- Step 1: Reported WC (per trial balance / balance sheet) for each period.
- Step 2: Definitional adjustments (deal definition alignment; remove cash, debt-like, non-operational).
  (Corpus uses “definitional adjustments” framing; see project-autobahn and project-skyrocket in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- Step 3: Diligence adjustments (one-offs, cut-off corrections, out-of-period accruals, unusual timing items).
  (Corpus examples: cut-off methodology alignments, out-of-period entries, one-time bad debt, etc. in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- Step 4: Pro forma / run-rate adjustments (only if clearly tied to a QoE pro forma change; label linkage explicitly).
  (Corpus examples: “WC impact of QoE adjustments” and DSO/DPO-based estimations in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- Output: normalized range (preferred) or point estimate (only if seasonality is low and supported). If only period-end snapshots exist, include snapshot limitation caveat.
  (Ref pitfall in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`.)

## Peg / target and implications — required phrasing rules

Only include a surplus/deficit conclusion if BOTH are true:

- Target basis/value is sourced (SPA/offer letter/seller schedule), and
- The comparison period is explicit (e.g., “LTM average”, “12 months prior to completion”, “as at close date”).

Standard phrasing options:

- If target is defined in a deal document:
  “Based on the target NWC definition in [Source], normalized NWC for [Period] is $[x] versus a target of $[y], implying a $[delta] surplus/(deficit) on this basis.”
  (Corpus form: “On this basis… deficit compared to the working capital target” in project-y; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- If target basis is defined but value not finalized:
  “The deal definition indicates a target based on [basis]. A target value has not been finalized; we have therefore presented normalized NWC by month/quarter and the implied range under the defined basis as an input to negotiations.”
  (Corpus form: offer-letter “defined ‘normal/target’… average of 12 months…” and alternative target framing; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- If no target definition:
  “A working capital target/definition has not been provided; we have focused on normalized working capital behavior and key sensitivities. Target mechanics remain a P0 open item.”

## Open-item behavior when data is missing

- Convert missing-data impacts into explicit open items with priority:
  - P0: prevents normalization or peg conclusion
  - P1: affects sizing of specific adjustments
  - P2: presentation / readability improvements
- Each open item must include “why it matters” and the requested artifact (e.g., “monthly TB by account”, “AR aging as of [date]”).
  (Ref open items discipline in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md` and QC requirement in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`.)

## Style rules (2B)

- Lead with the metric + so-what (house rule: “so what” in first 1–2 sentences; `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/writing-standards.md`).
- Use corpus-consistent causal language: “primarily driven by… offset by…”, “as a result…”, “on this basis…”
  (Corpus: multiple entries in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)
- Replace spatial references (“adjacent table”) with exhibit labels.
- Avoid absolute claims; label uncertainty and management-sourced items.
- Use consistent periods/units within the section.

## QA checks (5C pass/fail gates)

Hard fail (must fix before delivery)

- Missing definition table.
- Any material number presented without a basis/source line.
- Units/periods inconsistent within the section.
- Placeholder artifacts present: “Not present in source report”, “[ENTITY]”, “DD MM 20X”, “££”, “...”.
  (Ref do-not-deliver gates in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`.)

Standard QC scan

- Evidence–narrative alignment: opening claim is supported by Exhibit WC-1/WC-2 or reframed as open item.
- Normalization caveat included once (not repeated).
- Peg section: only present if target definition/value is sourced; otherwise converted to P0 open item.
- Open items list present and prioritized (P0/P1/P2).
  (Ref QC dimensions in `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/qc-checklist.md`.)
```

5. Draft markdown section template (implementable)

```markdown
# Working capital

## Key takeaway

- Normalized net working capital (“NWC”) for [Period] is $[x] (reported: $[y]), driven primarily by [Driver 1] and [Driver 2]. [Implication sentence: cash flow / peg sensitivity / close-date risk], subject to the deal definition and the data limitations noted below.
- Potential adjustments reflect information provided by management to date and may not be all-inclusive; additional procedures and access to supporting data could result in changes. (Corpus-consistent caveat; see `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)

## Working capital definition

**Definition used for this analysis:** [Deal definition name, e.g., “Net Working Capital per draft SPA dated YYYY-MM-DD” or “Management definition (deal definition not provided)”]

| Included (operating)                               | Excluded (non-operating / debt-like / other)                         | Rationale / notes                                                                           |

| Inventory                                          | Debt-like items (e.g., accrued interest, lease liabilities)          | Exclude items driven by financing decisions rather than operating working capital.          |
| Prepaids and other current assets (operating)      | Income taxes payable / sales taxes payable (if defined as debt-like) | Aligns to deal definition; varies by transaction.                                           |
| Accounts payable (trade)                           | Capex payables (if separated)                                        | Capex-related payables are often treated outside operating WC; confirm definition.          |
| Accrued liabilities (operating)                    | Shareholder-related balances / due to sellers                        | Non-operational; expected to settle pre-close or treated outside operating WC.              |
| Deferred revenue / customer deposits (if included) | Other non-trade / non-current balances                               | Ensure classification is consistent with period and source records.                         |

**Basis:** Source: [trial balance extract / balance sheet schedule] dated [YYYY-MM-DD]; management-provided schedules where noted.

## Historical working capital behavior (trend and drivers)

### Trend overview

- Reported NWC averaged $[x] over [Period] and was $[y] as at [Date]. (Units: $[k/m].)
- Adjusted NWC averaged $[x_adj] over [Period]. (Define “adjusted” = post-definitional + diligence adjustments.)

### Key drivers (tie to accounts and periods)

- Accounts receivable: [DSO if available] days in [Period], driven by [billing / collections / customer mix], based on [AR aging / TB].
- Inventory: [DIO if available] days in [Period], with [seasonality / build pattern] if evidenced.
- Accounts payable / accruals: [DPO if available] days in [Period], driven by [terms / timing / one-offs].

**If only period-end snapshots are available:** We have only period-end balances for [Periods], which may not capture intra-year seasonality. (Template-aligned limitation; see `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md`.)

## Normalized vs actual (definition alignment + diligence adjustments)

### Exhibit WC-1: NWC bridge (Reported → Adjusted/Normalized)

**Period:** [FY2023–FY2025 / TTM to YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Units:** $[k/m]  
**Source:** [trial balance / management WC schedule / sell-side report], dated [YYYY-MM-DD]; KPMG analysis

### Key diligence adjustments (narrative summary)

For each material adjustment, use this structure (corpus-consistent “This adjustment…” pattern; see `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`):

- **[Adjustment name] (Type: definitional / diligence / pro forma):** [What it is]. This adjustment [removes/excludes/normalizes/reallocates] [account] to reflect [rationale]. **Impact:** $[x] (increase/(decrease) NWC). **Basis:** [source]. **Residual risk:** [what could change].
- **[Adjustment name]:** …

## Peg / target and close implications (conditional)

### Deal target status

- **Target definition provided:** [Yes/No]. **Source:** [SPA/offer letter/seller schedule], dated [YYYY-MM-DD].
- **Target basis:** [e.g., “12-month average prior to completion”] (use explicit basis wording where applicable; corpus example in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`).
- **Target value:** $[y] (if agreed) / Not provided (P0).

### Comparison to target (only if target value is sourced)

- Based on the target definition in [Source], normalized NWC for [Period] is $[x] versus a target of $[y], implying a $[delta] surplus/(deficit) on this basis. (Corpus-consistent “On this basis…” deficit framing; see project-y in `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)

### Implications and sensitivities

- **Cash flow sensitivity:** [qualitative; quantify only if supported by data].
- **Close-date considerations:** [seasonality / known spikes / timing items].
- **Negotiation considerations (if applicable):** If the deal target is based on a historical averaging period, changes in the business trajectory may imply a different forward-looking target; present this as an analytical sensitivity, not a conclusion. (Corpus example: offer-letter passage and implied target step-up; `context/docs/report-mining/section-corpus/sections/working-capital.md`.)

## Open items & data requests (required; prioritize)

### P0 (gates conclusions)

- [ ] Provide deal definition of NWC (included/excluded accounts; treatment of cash and debt-like items) and target basis/value. **Why it matters:** required to conclude on surplus/deficit vs target.
- [ ] Provide monthly/quarterly balance sheet detail for WC accounts for [Period]. **Why it matters:** required to assess seasonality and derive normalized range.

### P1 (improves sizing/defensibility)

- [ ] AR aging by month-end for [Period]; credit notes/rebates detail. **Why it matters:** supports DSO and AR normalization.
- [ ] AP aging by month-end; capex payables identification. **Why it matters:** supports DPO and definitional separations.
- [ ] Inventory detail / reserves (if applicable). **Why it matters:** supports DIO and obsolescence considerations.
- [ ] Deferred revenue / customer deposits detail (if applicable). **Why it matters:** supports inclusion/exclusion and seasonality.

### P2 (presentation / completeness)

- [ ] Confirm any known one-off events affecting WC (cut-off changes, programs like factoring, etc.) and provide supporting schedules.

If you want, the next logical step (still no questions needed) is to diff these drafts against the current baseline at `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/section-templates/working-capital.md` and `context/skill/kpmg-fdd/references/analysis-playbooks/working-capital-playbook.md`, then translate the differences into prompt rules + lint checks in the skill’s implementation layer.
