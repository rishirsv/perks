# TS SoW — Agent Instructions

## Purpose

This project contains artifacts intended to be uploaded into a ChatGPT GPT / project workspace (system prompt + supporting files).

## Decision principles

- Prefer **defaults + derivations** over asking/gating users (smooth UX, fewer loops).
- Only keep schema fields that are **meaningfully user-provided**; if a value is a reasonable default, bake it into the template (or derive it) and **remove the schema + intake questions**.
- Never rewrite legal language; only change templates to (a) set defaults, (b) add deterministic markers, or (c) remove/replace placeholders.
- Keep the system prompt under `8000` characters.
- Keep practical headroom in the system prompt (`<= 7200` target) to reduce late-stage compression regressions.

## `dist/` (final uploads only)

The `chatgpt/ts-sow/dist/` directory is **only** for the exact files a user should upload into ChatGPT.

Keep `dist/` limited to:

- System prompt markdown(s)
- Prompt sidecar guidance docs referenced by the system prompt (e.g. `assistant-playbook.md`)
- Generator scripts needed by the prompt
- Template `.docx` files
- The current schema(s) / library files referenced by the prompt (e.g. `scope-library.json`)
- Any icon assets explicitly used for the GPT configuration

Do **not** add to `dist/`:

- Demo artifacts (example outputs, example variable dumps)
- Test outputs or golden files
- Local caches (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- OS/editor metadata (`.DS_Store`, etc.)

If you need demo or test materials, put them under `chatgpt/ts-sow/reference/` (or another non-`dist/` folder) instead.

## Hygiene

- Prefer writing generated outputs to a temporary or dedicated non-`dist/` location.
- Before finishing a change, verify `dist/` contains only final-upload artifacts.
- For prompt changes, run:
  - `python3 scripts/check-system-prompt-contract.py --prompt dist/ts-engagement-assistant.md --max-chars 7200`
- Validate outputs are “clean”: no remaining `{{...}}` tokens in generated `.docx`.
- For scope text changes, treat `dist/scope-library.json` as canonical.
- Keep `docs/scope-library/industries/*` synced to `dist` (re-export with `python3 scripts/export-scope-library.py`).
- `reference/legacy/*` contains historical snapshots only (not authoritative).
- For scope text QA, run:
  - `python3 scripts/check-scope-spelling.py`
  - `python3 scripts/validate-scope-exports.py`
  - `python3 -m json.tool dist/scope-library.json >/dev/null`
  - `python3 -m json.tool dist/scope-review-buckets.json >/dev/null`

## Scope Library Review Workflow (Docs-first)

When scope cleanup is in review mode, use `docs/scope-library/industries` as the working review surface.

- Update/review full per-industry outputs in:
  - `docs/scope-library/industries/*.json`
  - `docs/scope-library/industries/*.md`
- Regenerate industry files with:
  - `python3 scripts/export-scope-library.py`
- Only generate skeleton pack when explicitly requested:
  - `python3 scripts/export-scope-library.py --with-skeleton`
- Do not update `dist/scope-library.json` unless the user explicitly says to finalize/canonicalize changes.
- After exports, always run:
  - `python3 scripts/validate-scope-exports.py`
  - `python3 scripts/check-scope-spelling.py`

## Section Applicability (Docs-layer)

Use `docs/scope-library/section-applicability.json` to control industry behavior during docs export without changing `dist/scope-library.json`.

- `section_applicability.common_skeleton.<section>.exclude_for_industries`
  - Excludes a common section for listed industries.
  - Example: exclude `revenue_analysis` for `banking`.
- `common_section_replacements.<section>`
  - Replaces a common skeleton section for all industries (after exclusions are applied).
  - Use this when a “common” section is too industry-biased and needs neutral baseline wording.
- `industry_section_replacements.<industry>.<section>`
  - Replaces the base industry section bullets (full replacement) for review-mode exports.
  - Use this to remove redundancy and keep only incremental industry content.
- `industry_section_additions.<industry>.<section>`
  - Appends or creates bullets for a section after replacements are applied.
  - Use this for new sections (or incremental adds where replacement is not required).

Workflow:

1. Update `docs/scope-library/section-applicability.json`.
2. Regenerate exports:
   - `python3 scripts/export-scope-library.py`
   - Optional skeleton pack: `python3 scripts/export-scope-library.py --with-skeleton`
3. Validate:
   - `python3 scripts/validate-scope-exports.py`
   - `python3 scripts/check-scope-spelling.py`

Notes:

- Applicability config is docs-review behavior only until canonicalized in `dist/scope-library.json`.
- Prefer replacements over layered additions when duplicate/overlapping bullets appear in the same section.

## Banking Revenue Drafting Standard

For banking-oriented revenue wording, prefer income-stream framing over generic product sales framing.

Use this structure when drafting/revising banking revenue scope:

Revenue - Gain an understanding of income streams by type, including:

a) Net interest margin - trends therein / evolution thereof, including:
   i. Interest rate profile (fixed vs variable; differences by term / duration);
   ii. Product features (variable/floating and fixed);
   iii. Changes in maturity profile (including extensions of amortization periods and impact on yields); and
   iv. Cost of funding.

b) Non-interest income / margin - trends therein and key drivers (service charges, card/payment fees, wealth/asset-management fees, trading/treasury results, and other recurring non-interest streams).

c) Other fee income and commissions - trends therein and noted one-time / non-cash items.

## Constraint

- System prompt is limited to 8000 characters

## Template/generator conventions

- **Guidance text:** bracketed guidance like `[GUIDANCE: ...]` is intended to **remain in the output** for humans to edit; only curly-brace guidance placeholders (e.g. `{{GUIDANCE_01}}`, `{{GUIDANCE: ...}}`) are internal and should be removed during generation.
- **Section removal:** prefer explicit marker paragraphs (e.g. `{{BLOCK_*_START}}` / `{{BLOCK_*_END}}`) so the generator can delete entire sections deterministically.
- **Generation invocation contract:** always call `el-generate.py` via subprocess flags, and pass `--variables` as a JSON file path (temp file), not a long inline JSON string.
- **Independence behavior (intended):**
  - If `CHOICE_INDEPENDENCE_APPLIES=no`, remove the full Independence Considerations block.
  - `CHOICE_SEC_STATUS` is conditionally required only when `CHOICE_INDEPENDENCE_APPLIES=yes` and the section remains in-template.
- **Canvas behavior (intended):**
  - Canvas is a review layer; working variables are source of truth.
  - Re-render full Canvas each turn (never partial line patches).
  - If Canvas update fails, continue generation flow with working variables and add a brief stale-canvas warning.
- **Scope exclusion contract (intended):**
  - Prefer `scope_selection.excluded_section_keys` over id-only exclusions.
  - Use `excluded_top_level_ids` only as backward-compatible fallback.
  - If user accepts full scope, pass no exclusions.
- **Scope review mapping (intended):**
  - Keep `scope-review-buckets.json` aligned with `scope-library.json` section keys.
  - Maintain `section_aliases` for common user phrasing.
  - Maintain `concept_aliases` + `concept_to_sections` for concept-wide removals (for example, debt-like exclusions).
- When updating templates, apply changes consistently to **both** buyside and sellside unless explicitly scoped to one.

## Repo note

- `chatgpt/ts-sow` and `chatgpt/TS-SoW` may refer to the same files; use the git-tracked paths when staging/committing.
