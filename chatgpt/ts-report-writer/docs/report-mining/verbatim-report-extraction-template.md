# Verbatim Report Extraction Template (All Reports)

Use this template to capture **actual report text only** (no rewriting).

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Copy text **verbatim** from source report outputs.
- Do **not** summarize, interpret, or normalize wording.
- Keep placeholders like `[ENTITY]`, `[DATE]`, `[X]` if present in source.
- If a section is missing, write: `Not present in source report`.
- Keep original section order where possible.

## Report Metadata

- `SOURCE_FILE`:
- `REPORT_ID`:
- `SOURCE_PATH`:
- `EXTRACTION_STATUS`:
- `EXTRACTION_DATE`:

## Required Source Evidence

- `SOURCE_TEXT_DIR`: (e.g. `extracted/verification/<report-id>/source-text/pptx` or `.../pdf`)
- `MONTAGE_DIR`: (e.g. `extracted/verification/<report-id>/montage`)
- `SOURCE_ARTIFACTS`:
  - `slide-01.txt` or `page-01.txt` ...
- `OCR_USED`:
  - `true/false`
- `OCR_SLIDES`:
  - `[]` or `[16, 17, 22]`

## Source-to-Extraction Coverage Map

Use this section to prove every extracted item is verbatim-backed by source text.

| Canonical Section | Source slide/page IDs | Source evidence files | Extracted reference(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quality of Earnings | 16,17,18,19,20,21,22 | `slide-16.txt`, `slide-17.txt` | `## Quality of earnings adjustments` list items 1-13 | `[x]` |

If any line in the extracted report is shortened, summarized, or paraphrased, set `Notes` to explain and keep status as `needs_revision` until corrected.

If OCR was used, source artifacts will include an `"[OCR_EXTRACTED_TEXT]"` section; keep those entries for audit only and ensure they are not copied into normal extracted markdown unless source text is proven required.
