# KPMG GPT Inventory (TS) — Portable Skill

This skill standardizes a single “master inventory deck” where each GPT has a repeatable one‑pager slide.

The **right column is always a screenshot placeholder frame** (teams add real screenshots later).

## Source of truth

- Deck spec JSON: `deck/ts-custom-gpts-portfolio.json`
- Vendored runtime: `runtime/kpmg-diligence/`
- Generator entrypoint: `runtime/kpmg-diligence/generator/index.js`
- Validation: `runtime/kpmg-diligence/generator/validate.js`

## Quick start (happy path)

1) Add a new GPT slide (recommended):
- Run: `python3 dist/kpmg-gpt-inventory/scripts/add_gpt.py --help`
- Then: `python3 dist/kpmg-gpt-inventory/scripts/build_inventory_deck.py`

2) Review:
- Open the rendered PNGs under the run folder printed by the build script.
- Fix copy length or icon paths, then re-run the build script.

## Adding a GPT (standard one‑pager format)

Use `scripts/add_gpt.py` to append a new slide to the inventory deck with:
- Slide title = GPT name
- Strapline = 1 concise sentence
- Left column sections (each should be 2–3 bullets):
  - Problem
  - How we solve it
  - Outcome / ROI
- Right column:
  - Icon path (PNG preferred; SVG allowed)
  - Screenshot placeholder caption (1 sentence describing the desired screenshot)

This repo’s deck uses two optional slide fields for consistent executive formatting:
- `iconPlacement: "titleLeft"` to align the icon with the slide title.
- `style: { bodyFontSize: 11, straplineFontSize: 11, iconSize: 0.62 }` for executive readability and a larger icon.

### Copy rules (hard requirements)

- No technical terms on-slide (avoid “JSON”, “schema”, “validator”, etc.).
- Straplines must be active and benefit-focused (start with a verb, say what it enables).
- Each bullet should be **1–2 complete sentences** (prefer 2) and end with a period.
- Use “before → after” framing in Problem and Outcome / ROI.
- For readability, aim for **2 bullets per section** (up to 3 if needed), rather than one dense paragraph.
- Tighten aggressively by removing filler, combining overlaps, and keeping “what it does” language direct.
- Outcomes should be specific about time and quality gains (speed, consistency, rework reduction, decision support).
- Keep voice consistent: active verbs, parallel structure, and smooth Problem → How → Outcome flow.

### Formatting rules (hard requirements)

- Keep `leftBody` bullets **flat** (no nested arrays). Use the pattern: header line → bullet line → bullet line, then the next header.
- Do not put excerpt content in the right column. The right column is reserved for the screenshot placeholder frame only.

See: `references/copy-template.md` for a fill‑in template.
See: `references/deck-model.md` for the exact JSON shape.

## Build + inspection loop

Run:

`python3 dist/kpmg-gpt-inventory/scripts/build_inventory_deck.py`

This will:
1) Validate the deck spec.
2) Generate a PPTX into a timestamped `outputs/runs/...` folder.
3) Produce inspection artifacts next to the PPTX (strict summary + overlap/bounds reports + a short markdown report).

### What “inspection” means here

- **Automated checks**:
  - Overlap detection (strict mode overlap report).
  - Out-of-bounds detection (strict bounds report).
  - Missing required slot checks (strict diagnostics).
  - Warnings captured during generation.
- **Human review**:
  - Open the PPTX and spot-check layout, especially on long-text slides.

### Fixing issues (what to change)

Prefer fixing issues by:
1) Tightening copy (without losing completeness).
2) Splitting a section into multiple bullets (still 2–3 sentences each).
3) Adjusting slide ordering if narrative impact is improved.

Only if needed, adjust layout behavior in the builders (this repo), then rebuild the deck and re-run inspection.

## Dependencies (for rendering)

No external rendering binaries are required for this dist bundle.

## Scripts in this skill

- `scripts/add_gpt.py`: Add a GPT slide entry to the master deck JSON.
- `scripts/build_inventory_deck.py`: Generate PPTX and write an inspection report.
