# KPMG Slide Generator (Plain-English Guide)

This project turns structured slide input into KPMG-style PowerPoint decks using a deterministic generator.

## What this system does

- You provide a `deckSpec` (what slides you want and what content goes in each slot).
- The renderer applies the KPMG Diligence+ layout package (tokens, geometry, assets, masters).
- The system produces two outputs every run: a `.pptx` and a `.qa.json` report.

## Simple end-to-end flow

1. Read the template package (`tokens`, `layouts`, and assets manifest).
2. Validate each slide against strict slot rules and density thresholds.
3. Auto-paginate long text/table content to avoid collisions.
4. Render each slide with the correct builder and master chrome.
5. Run QA diagnostics (including overlap checks by default).
6. Save `deck.pptx` and `deck.qa.json`.

## File-by-file guide

### `generator/index.js`

- This is the main command-line entry point used to generate decks.
- It validates input, renders the deck, runs QA checks, and writes output files.
- It now runs overlap checks by default and supports `--skip-overlap` when needed.

### `generator/validate.js`

- This is the standalone validator command for quick preflight checks.
- It loads the template package and validates a `deckSpec` without writing a deck.
- It is useful in CI when you want to fail fast before rendering.

### `generator/tokens.js`

- This centralizes core style defaults (fonts, colors, sizes, chart palette).
- Builders read these tokens so styling stays consistent across slide types.
- Body text is now standardized to Arial 10.

### `generator/runtime/render-deck.js`

- This is the runtime “brain” that maps each slide type to the right builder.
- It enforces strict, type-aware slot validation and density scoring before render.
- It also controls master selection, deterministic page numbering, and QA payload assembly.

### `generator/runtime/paginate.js`

- This file splits content deterministically when text or tables are too long.
- It avoids overlap by creating continuation slides in predictable ways.
- It records pagination decisions and overflow events for the QA report.

### `generator/runtime/template-package.js`

- This helper renders slide titles in a consistent visual style.
- It centralizes title spacing/format behavior used by multiple builders.
- It reduces repeated code in layout-specific files.

- This helper sanitizes text and calculates practical text box behavior.
- It provides reusable text-height and line-wrap safety utilities.
- It helps builders avoid accidental overflow and bad formatting.

### `generator/helpers/media.js`

- This helper normalizes image/media sources before insertion.
- It supports consistent handling of local path-based assets.
- It keeps media rendering logic centralized.

### `generator/helpers/svg.js`
