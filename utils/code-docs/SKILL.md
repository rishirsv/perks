# Code Docs

## Objective
Create or update repository documentation using canonical structure and naming. Keep docs agent-legible, layered, and mechanically verifiable.

## Scope
This skill manages:
- root docs (`AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TODOS.md`)
- docs policy/reference docs and index files
- product specs (`docs/product-specs/*`) for planning and post-implementation documentation
- execution planning docs (`docs/exec-plans/*`)
- solution knowledge docs (optional, when explicitly requested)

This skill does not own execution of feature code changes. It can inspect source code to document behavior and contracts.

## Hard Rules
- Edit docs only (`.md`, `.txt`) unless user says otherwise.
- Do not modify source code/tests/config/dependencies.
- Create files only when user asks, except when updating an existing scaffold where matching index links are required.
- Use canonical names/paths by default.
- Do not create legacy alias paths.
- Ground implementation-derived content in repository evidence; avoid guessing.
- Do not include looks-real product specifics in templates. Use placeholders unless explicitly marked as examples.
- Respect layered instruction ecosystems:
  - If repo already uses `CLAUDE.md` and/or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, do not create competing guidance by default.
  - If nested `AGENTS.md` files exist, preserve precedence and keep root guidance high-level.
- For canonical docs/specs, use metadata frontmatter fields:
  - `owner`
  - `status`
  - `last-reviewed`
  - `review-cycle-days`
  - `source-of-truth`
  - `verification-state`

## Canonical Paths (when scaffolding exists)
Root:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TODOS.md`

`docs/`:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/ISSUES.md`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- `docs/FRONTEND.md`
- `docs/PLANS.md`
- `docs/PRODUCT_SENSE.md`
- `docs/RELIABILITY.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/DB-SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/design-docs/index.md`
- `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md`
- `docs/product-specs/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/active/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/completed/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
- `docs/references/*`
- `docs/research/*`
- `docs/artifacts/*`

## Defaults
- If user provides path, use it.
- If user provides doc type only, use canonical path when scaffold exists.
- If scaffold is absent, do not force-create missing files; keep requested docs self-contained.
- Preserve existing structure and tone unless user asks for rewrite.

## Metadata Semantics
- `status`: `draft` | `active` | `deprecated`
- `verification-state`: `unverified` | `partially-verified` | `verified`
- A doc marked `verification-state: verified` must include at least one concrete verification method.

## Scaffolding-Aware AGENTS Behavior
When creating/updating `AGENTS.md`:
1. Detect if full scaffolding exists.
2. If scaffolding exists, include a concise table of contents with valid links.
3. If scaffolding does not exist, keep `AGENTS.md` standalone and add optional suggested docs as recommendations only.
4. Never require missing files unless the user explicitly asks to create them.

## Issues Handling
- Use `docs/ISSUES.md` as single issue registry by default.
- Append issue blocks using `assets/issue-block_template.md` format.
- Create per-issue files only when explicitly requested, using `assets/issue-file_template.md`.

## Product Specs Handling
- Canonical path: `docs/product-specs/<feature-slug>-spec.md`.
- Default structure: `assets/product-spec_template.md`.
- Prefer updating an existing spec for the same feature instead of creating duplicates.
- Support both modes:
  - Planning mode: document intended behavior, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.
  - Post-implementation mode: inspect feature code and docs, document shipped behavior, and update scope/contracts.
- For post-implementation updates, explore before writing:
  1. Identify entry routes/screens and owner modules.
  2. Identify user-visible behavior, constraints, and non-goals.
  3. Map requirements and acceptance criteria to shipped behavior.
  4. Record references to relevant code and docs paths.
- If uncertain, put unknowns in `Open Questions` and state missing evidence.
- Keep specs concise and decision-oriented.

## Cross-Skill Alignment
- `ideate` handles discovery and brainstorming.
- `code-docs` handles canonical spec/doc writing and maintenance.
- `designer` can own full design detail; `code-docs` keeps durable design map placeholders when requested.

## Assets
| Document Type | Asset | Canonical Path |
|---|---|---|
| README | `assets/README_template.md` | `README.md` |
| Repo guidelines | `assets/AGENTS_template.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Architecture | `assets/ARCHITECTURE_template.md` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Todos | `assets/TODOS_template.md` | `TODOS.md` |
| Docs index | `assets/docs-README_template.md` | `docs/README.md` |
| Issues registry | `assets/ISSUES_template.md` | `docs/ISSUES.md` |
| Issue block | `assets/issue-block_template.md` | append to `docs/ISSUES.md` |
| Per-issue file (optional) | `assets/issue-file_template.md` | `docs/issues/<id>.md` |
| Design policy placeholder | `assets/DESIGN_template.md` | `docs/DESIGN.md` |
| Frontend contracts | `assets/FRONTEND_template.md` | `docs/FRONTEND.md` |
| Plans rules | `assets/PLANS_template.md` | `docs/PLANS.md` |
| Exec plan file | `assets/exec-plan_template.md` | `docs/exec-plans/active/<feature-slug>-plan.md` |
| Product sense | `assets/PRODUCT_SENSE_template.md` | `docs/PRODUCT_SENSE.md` |
| Reliability policy | `assets/RELIABILITY_template.md` | `docs/RELIABILITY.md` |
| Security policy | `assets/SECURITY_template.md` | `docs/SECURITY.md` |
| DB schema digest | `assets/DB-SCHEMA_template.md` | `docs/DB-SCHEMA.md` |
| Design docs index | `assets/design-docs_index_template.md` | `docs/design-docs/index.md` |
| Core beliefs | `assets/core-beliefs_template.md` | `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md` |
| Product spec | `assets/product-spec_template.md` | `docs/product-specs/<feature-slug>-spec.md` |
| Tech debt tracker | `assets/tech-debt-tracker_template.md` | `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` |
| Solution runbook (optional) | `assets/solution_template.md` | `docs/solutions/<solution-slug>.md` |

## Workflow
1. Confirm requested docs and scope.
2. Discover existing conventions and detect scaffolding/layered instruction files.
3. Select matching assets.
4. Apply assets with required metadata and path-anchored references.
5. Ensure quality checks are represented (verification method, ownership, next actions).
6. Return save summary (paths only).
