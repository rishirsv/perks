# Code Docs

## Objective

Create or update repository documentation using canonical structure and naming. Keep docs agent-legible, layered, and mechanically verifiable.

## Scope

This skill manages:

- root docs (`AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TODOS.md`)
- docs policy/reference docs and index files
- product specs (`docs/product-specs/*`) for planning and post-implementation documentation
- project specs (`docs/project-specs/*`) for system/service-level specification work
- execution planning docs (`docs/exec-plans/*`)
- solution knowledge docs (optional, when explicitly requested)

This skill does not own execution of feature code changes. It can inspect source code to document behavior and contracts.

## Hard Rules

- Edit docs only (`.md`, `.txt`) unless user says otherwise.
- Do not modify source code/tests/config/dependencies.
- Create files only when user asks, except when updating an existing scaffold where matching index links are required.
- Use canonical names/paths by default.
- Do not create legacy alias paths.
- Treat `docs/DESIGN.md` as the canonical, consolidated design context file; do not create `.design/` context folders unless the user explicitly asks.
- Ground implementation-derived content in repository evidence; avoid guessing.
- Do not include looks-real product specifics in templates. Use placeholders unless explicitly marked as examples.
- Respect layered instruction ecosystems:
  - If repo already uses `CLAUDE.md` and/or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, do not create competing guidance by default.
  - If nested `AGENTS.md` files exist, preserve precedence and keep root guidance high-level.
- For canonical docs/specs, use metadata frontmatter fields:
  - `status`
  - `last-reviewed`
  - `review-cycle-days`
  - `source-of-truth`
  - `verification-state`

## Canonical Paths (when scaffolding exists)

Root:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TODOS.md`

`docs/`:

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/ISSUES.md`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- `docs/FRONTEND.md`
- `docs/PLANS.md`
- `docs/PRODUCT_SENSE.md`
- `docs/RELIABILITY.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`
- `docs/DB-SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/design-docs/index.md`
- `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md`
- `docs/product-specs/*`
- `docs/project-specs/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/active/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/completed/*`
- `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
- `docs/references/*`
- `docs/research/*`
- `docs/artifacts/*`

## Defaults

- If user provides path, use it.
- If user provides doc type only, use canonical path when scaffold exists.
- If scaffold is absent, do not force-create missing files; keep requested docs self-contained.
- Preserve existing structure and tone unless user asks for rewrite.

## Metadata Semantics

- `status`: `draft` | `active` | `deprecated`
- `verification-state`: `unverified` | `partially-verified` | `verified`
- A doc marked `verification-state: verified` must include at least one concrete verification method.

## Scaffolding-Aware AGENTS Behavior

When creating/updating `AGENTS.md`:

1. Detect if full scaffolding exists.
2. If scaffolding exists, include a concise table of contents with valid links.
3. If scaffolding does not exist, keep `AGENTS.md` standalone and add optional suggested docs as recommendations only.
4. Never require missing files unless the user explicitly asks to create them.

## Issues Handling

- Use `docs/ISSUES.md` as single issue registry by default.
- Append issue blocks using `assets/issue-block_template.md` format.
- Create per-issue files only when explicitly requested, using `assets/issue-file_template.md`.

## Product Specs Handling

- Canonical path: `docs/product-specs/<feature-slug>-spec.md`.
- Default structure: `assets/product-spec_template.md`.
- Prefer updating an existing spec for the same feature instead of creating duplicates.
- Do not invoke explore agents/subagents for product specs; explore directly in the current session.
- Support both modes:
  - Planning mode: document intended behavior, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.
  - Post-implementation mode: inspect already-shipped feature code and docs, then document as-built behavior and scope/contracts.
- For post-implementation specs, explore before writing:
  1. Identify entry routes/screens/commands and owner modules.
  2. Identify user-visible behavior, constraints, and non-goals from implementation.
  3. Identify distinctive/unique feature behaviors across the application.
  4. Map requirements and acceptance criteria to shipped behavior and note mismatches.
  5. Record references to relevant code and docs paths.
- If evidence is incomplete, state missing evidence explicitly in `Assumptions` or `Context`.
- Keep specs concise and decision-oriented.

## Project Specs Handling

- Canonical path: `docs/project-specs/<project-slug>-spec.md`.
- Default structure: `assets/project-spec_template.md`.
- Use this when the user requests a project/service/system specification (architecture, operations, integrations, and validation strategy), not a single feature spec.
- Keep placeholders until concrete project inputs are provided.
- Preserve the full spec shape from the template (problem statement, goals/non-goals, domain model, workflow/config contracts, failure model, validation matrix, implementation checklist).
- If implementation-derived evidence is incomplete, call it out explicitly instead of guessing.

## Workflow

1. Confirm requested docs and scope.
2. Discover existing conventions and detect scaffolding/layered instruction files.
3. Select matching assets.
4. Apply assets with required metadata and path-anchored references.
5. Ensure quality checks are represented (verification method, ownership, next actions).
6. Return save summary (paths only).
