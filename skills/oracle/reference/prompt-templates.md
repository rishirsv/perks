# Oracle Prompt Templates

Use these templates to generate `prompt.md` for ChatGPT Pro or another external expert model.

Review-oriented templates assume the downstream model sees only `context.zip`.
The Ultraplan template assumes the downstream model sees only `context.txt`.
Copy the smallest template that fits, then trim anything you do not need.
For reusable building blocks, see [prompt-blocks.md](prompt-blocks.md).

## Role Values

Replace `{ROLE}` with one of these:

| Task Type | Role Value |
|-----------|------------|
| Code review | a staff engineer doing a careful code review for correctness and maintainability |
| Debugging | a senior engineer debugging a tricky issue with limited context |
| Architecture | a principal engineer reviewing system design |
| Security | a security engineer threat-modeling and reviewing deployment hardening |
| Performance | a performance engineer identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities |
| Data/SQL | a database engineer reviewing correctness and performance |
| UI/UX | an expert UI/UX designer doing a rigorous visual and interaction review |
| Prompting | a prompt engineer improving Codex or GPT-5.4 prompts for reliability and clarity |
| Planning | a principal engineer creating a high-confidence implementation plan for a complex change in an unfamiliar codebase |

## Ultraplan Template

```xml
<task>
You are {ROLE}.

I am uploading `context.txt` containing a curated repository slice and manifest.
Treat `context.txt` as authoritative.
Start by reading the manifest section at the top of `context.txt`.

Create a high-confidence implementation plan for this task.
Do not write code.
Do not stop for routine clarification.
Proceed with the best reasonable assumptions and label them explicitly.

Task: {TASK}
Success criteria: {SUCCESS_CRITERIA}
Constraints: {CONSTRAINTS}
Draft plan to refine, if provided: {SEED_PLAN}

Repository-specific preferences:
- Prefer the smallest change that fits the existing codebase.
- Avoid fallback solutions unless the task explicitly requires them.
- Separate observed facts, assumptions, and recommendations.
</task>

<structured_output_contract>
Return exactly these sections:
1. Current understanding
2. Assumptions and unknowns
3. Relevant file and system touchpoints
4. Options considered
5. Recommended approach
6. ## Approved Plan
7. Validation checklist
8. Risks and follow-ups

Inside `## Approved Plan`, include:
- phases with a short non-technical outcome for each phase
- an implementation checklist
- concrete validation steps
</structured_output_contract>

<default_follow_through_policy>
Default to the most reasonable low-risk interpretation and keep going.
Only stop to ask questions when a missing detail changes correctness or safety materially.
</default_follow_through_policy>

<completeness_contract>
Resolve the planning task fully before stopping.
Do not stop at the first plausible plan.
Check for edge cases, sequencing issues, missing validations, and risky assumptions before finalizing.
</completeness_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every concrete claim in `context.txt`.
Cite file paths for codebase claims.
If a point is an inference, label it clearly.
</grounding_rules>

<action_safety>
Keep the recommended plan tightly scoped to the stated task.
Avoid unrelated refactors, renames, or cleanup unless they are required for correctness.
Call out risky or irreversible actions explicitly.
</action_safety>

<verification_loop>
Before finalizing, verify that the plan matches the uploaded repository slice and the requested outcome.
If the first draft is underspecified, revise it instead of stopping early.
</verification_loop>
```

<dig_deeper_nudge>
After finding the first plausible issue, also check for second-order regressions, empty-state behavior, retries, stale state, and rollback paths.
