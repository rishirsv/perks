# Continual Learning

Keep `AGENTS.md` current using chat transcript deltas instead of full rescans.

## Inputs

- Codex chat roots:
  - `~/.codex/sessions/`
  - `~/.codex/archived_sessions/`
- Existing memory file: `AGENTS.md`
- Incremental index: `.codex/hooks/state/continual-learning-index.json`
- Canonical docs for conflict checks (when present):
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/DESIGN.md`
  - `docs/FRONTEND.md`
  - `docs/PLANS.md`
  - `docs/PRODUCT_SENSE.md`

## Workflow

1. Read existing `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Load incremental index if present.
3. Discover Codex chat transcript files and process only:
   - new files not in index, or
   - files whose mtime is newer than indexed mtime.
4. Extract only high-signal, reusable information:
   - recurring user corrections/preferences
   - durable workspace facts
5. Run a docs conflict check on each candidate bullet:
   - skip candidates already covered by canonical docs
   - skip candidates that contradict canonical docs
   - when a candidate partially overlaps a canonical rule, convert it to an `Update` proposal with rationale
6. Build a proposed merge with existing bullets in `AGENTS.md`:
   - update matching bullets in place
   - add only net-new bullets
   - deduplicate semantically similar bullets
7. Present proposed changes to the user and wait for explicit approval:
   - show exact bullets under `Add`, `Update`, and `Remove`
   - include a one-line rationale per proposed bullet
   - do not edit `AGENTS.md` yet
8. If and only if the user approves, apply the approved bullet changes to `AGENTS.md`.
9. Run memory aging and pruning checks:
   - if a learned bullet has no supporting evidence for 45 days, propose it in `Remove`
   - if a candidate has never been approved and remains stale for 90 days, prune it from index memory metadata
   - never auto-remove approved `AGENTS.md` bullets without user approval
10. Write back the incremental index:
   - store latest mtimes for processed files
   - remove entries for files that no longer exist
   - if changes are not approved, keep existing transcript index entries unchanged
   - always retain aging metadata needed for future stale/removal proposals

## Approval Gate (Required)

- Default behavior is suggestion-only.
- Never modify `AGENTS.md` without explicit user approval in the current thread.
- If approval is missing or ambiguous, ask for confirmation and stop before writing.
- Keep suggestions concise and in plain bullet form aligned to the output contract.

## Proposal Format (Required)

- Use exactly three sections in this order:
  - `### Add`
  - `### Update`
  - `### Remove`
- Under each section, use bullets with this shape:
  - `- <proposed bullet text> — <one-line rationale>`
- If a section has no items, write `- None`.
- Keep rationales factual and brief. No metadata tags.

## AGENTS.md Output Contract

- Keep only these sections:
  - `## Learned User Preferences`
  - `## Learned Workspace Facts`
- Use plain bullet points only.
- Do not write evidence/confidence tags.
- Do not write process instructions, rationale, or metadata blocks.

## Inclusion Bar

Keep an item only if all are true:

- actionable in future sessions
- stable across sessions
- repeated in multiple transcripts, or explicitly stated as a broad rule
- non-sensitive

## Exclusions

Never store:

- secrets, tokens, credentials, private personal data
- one-off task instructions
- transient details (branch names, commit hashes, temporary errors)

## Memory Aging Rules

- Track per-candidate memory metadata in the incremental index:
  - `firstSeenAt`
  - `lastSeenAt`
  - `seenCount`
  - `lastProposedAt`
  - `lastApprovedAt` (nullable)
- Stale thresholds:
  - 45 days without supporting evidence: propose removal from `AGENTS.md`.
  - 90 days stale and never approved: remove candidate metadata from index.
- Approval remains mandatory before any `AGENTS.md` deletion.
