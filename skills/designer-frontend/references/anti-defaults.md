# Anti-Defaults

Use this file as a binding ban list and reset point for product UI decisions. If a UI choice feels like a default AI UI move, ban it and pick the harder, cleaner option.

## Banned Moves

No oversized rounded corners.
No pill overload.
No floating glassmorphism shells as the default visual language.
No soft corporate gradients used to fake taste.
No generic dark SaaS UI composition.
No decorative sidebar blobs.
No "control room" cosplay unless explicitly requested.
No serif headline + system sans fallback combo as a shortcut to "premium."
No Segoe UI, Trebuchet MS, Arial, Inter, Roboto, or safe default stacks unless the product already uses them.
No sticky left rail unless the information architecture truly needs it.
No metric-card grid as the first instinct.
No fake charts that exist only to fill space.
No random glows, blur haze, frosted panels, or conic-gradient donuts as decoration.
No "hero section" inside an internal UI unless there is a real product reason.
No alignment that creates dead space just to look expensive.
No overpadded layouts.
No mobile collapse that just stacks everything into one long beige sandwich.
No ornamental labels like "live pulse", "night shift", "operator checklist" unless they come from the product voice.
No generic startup copy.
No style decisions made because they are easy to generate.
No Headlines of any sort

## Team Command

Team Command

Border radii in the 20px to 32px range across everything ( uses 12px everywhere - too much)
Repeating the same rounded rectangle on sidebar, cards, buttons, and panels
Sidebar width around 280px with a brand block on top and nav links below (: 248px with brand block)
Floating detached sidebar with rounded outer shell
Canvas chart placed in a glass card with no product-specific reason
Donut chart paired with hand-wavy percentages
UI cards using glows instead of hierarchy
Mixed alignment logic where some content hugs the left edge and some content floats in center-ish blocks
Overuse of muted gray-blue text that weakens contrast and clarity
"Premium dark mode" that really means blue-black gradients plus cyan accents ( has radial gradients in background)

Hero sections inside dashboards ( has full hero-strip with decorative copy)
Decorative copy like "Operational clarity without the clutter" as page headers
Section notes and mini-notes everywhere explaining what the UI does
Transform animations on hover (: translateX(2px) on nav links)
Dramatic box shadows (: 0 24px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.35))
Status indicators with ::before pseudo-elements creating colored dots
Muted labels with uppercase + letter-spacing ( overuses this pattern)

"Team focus" or "Recent activity" panels with decorative internal copy
Tables with tag badges for every status ( overuses .tag class)
Workspace blocks in sidebar with call-to-action buttons
Brand marks with gradient backgrounds (: linear-gradient(135deg, #2a2a2a, #171717))
