# Recent Code Bugfix

Find a bug introduced by the current author in the last week, implement a minimal fix, and verify it when possible. Work in the current directory and require the root cause to tie directly to the author's recent edits.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the recent-change scope

- Determine the author from `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
- If git config is unavailable, infer the current user from the environment. Ask once only if the author identity is still unclear.
- Use `git log --since=1.week --author=<author>` to identify recent commits and the files they touched.
- Focus investigation on files changed by those commits.
- If the user prompt is empty, use this default scope immediately.

### 2. Find a concrete failure tied to recent changes

- Prioritize defects that are directly attributable to the author's edits.
- Look for recent failures first: targeted test failures, lint failures, runtime errors, or local CI output that touches the changed files.
- If no failure is already available, run the smallest relevant verification for the edited area, such as a single test, file-level lint, or targeted repro.
- Confirm that the failing behavior is caused by the author's recent changes rather than unrelated legacy issues.
- If only unrelated failures are found, stop and report that no qualifying recent-author bug was detected.

### 3. Implement the fix

- Make the smallest change that resolves the confirmed issue.
- Update only the files needed for the fix.
- Follow local conventions, tests, and project patterns.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, speculative cleanups, or extra fallback logic unless the user asks for them.

### 4. Verify

- Prefer the smallest validation step that proves the fix, such as a targeted test, focused lint run, or direct reproduction command.
- If stronger verification is cheap and relevant, run it after the targeted check.
- If verification cannot be run, state exactly what would be run and why it was not executed.

### 5. Report

- Summarize the bug, root cause, and fix.
- State how the root cause ties directly to the author's recent changes.
- Summarize the verification that was run, or the verification that remains pending.

## Guardrails

- Stay focused on bugs introduced by the current author's changes within the last week.
- Do not claim a qualifying bug unless the root cause maps directly to those changes.
- Do not expand scope into general bug hunting, cleanup, or historical triage unless the user asks.
