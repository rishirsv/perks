# OAI Reference Copies

Refreshed on 2026-05-12 from the latest locally installed Codex sources on this machine.

These folders are reference material only. They are not active `perks` skills or installable plugin content.

## Refresh Notes

- The previous OAI reference tree was replaced with a deletion sync.
- Stale older folders such as `skills/docs`, `skills/pdfs`, and `skills/slides` were removed because their current installed counterparts are now represented as `skills/documents`, `skills/pdf`, and `presentations`.
- Symlinked runtime packages were copied with dereferenced files so the reference tree remains inspectable from the repo alone.
- `.DS_Store` files were removed.
