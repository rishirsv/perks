description: Review and polish frontend interfaces with a fast default loop or an explicit evaluator-led multi-pass loop. Use when the interface needs a quality pass that both diagnoses design issues and improves them, especially when the user asks for iterative polish, asks to use subagents, or wants a dedicated design evaluator.

# Polish Design

Polish frontend interfaces with a tight implementation loop by default, and switch to a stricter evaluator-led loop only when the user explicitly asks for subagents, a dedicated evaluator, or multi-pass critique.

Use `frontend-skill` as the design principles foundation. Every judgment call defers first to `docs/DESIGN.md` if it exists in the repo, then to `frontend-skill`, then to the evaluator rubric in `references/design-evaluation.md`.

## Priority Rule

- Check for `docs/DESIGN.md` in the project root. If it exists, read it first and treat it as the primary design context.
- Do not create or refresh `docs/DESIGN.md` silently.
- For evaluator-led runs, read `references/design-evaluation.md` before producing any score or recommendation.

## Mode Selection

Default to the single-agent loop unless the user explicitly requests one of these:

- use subagents
- use the `design-evaluator` agent
- run multiple evaluator-led passes
- compare passes, persist artifacts, or decide whether to refine, pivot, or stop

Examples that should trigger the evaluator-led path:

- `Use polish-design with subagents`
- `Run polish-design 3x with design-evaluator`
- `Use a design evaluator before each pass`
- `Use design-evaluator and pass the screenshot folder`

Examples that should stay in the default path:

- `Polish this page`
- `Give this dashboard one design pass`

## Default Loop

Use this path for most requests.

1. Review the current design in code.
2. Capture the current interface. If the capture is saved to disk, save it under `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/screens/`.
3. Audit the screenshot and code together.
4. Output concise findings in chat.
5. Implement 1-3 high-impact fixes.
6. Re-capture and confirm the result. If the capture is saved to disk, save it under `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/screens/`.

### Default Audit Categories

Organize concise findings under these categories:

1. Anti-Patterns & First Impression
2. Hierarchy, Composition & IA
3. Typography, Color & Copy
4. States, Edge Cases & Resilience
5. Motion & Performance

For each bullet: state the problem, where it is, severity (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`), and the fix direction in one line.

## Evaluator-Led Loop

Use this path only when the user explicitly asks for the heavier workflow.

The two roles are:

- `polisher`: owns design/code changes
- `evaluator`: judges the current state, scores it, and recommends the next move

The evaluator should be the dedicated `design-evaluator` Claude agent when available. The evaluator is read-only and must never take implementation ownership.

### Evaluator-Led Steps

1. Write a short polish contract and save it to `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/brief.md`.
2. Capture the current interface and save any screen files under `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/screens/`.
3. Ask the evaluator to score the interface using `references/design-evaluation.md`, and pass the run screenshot folder path.
4. Summarize the evaluator result in chat very concisely.
5. Implement only the highest-leverage fixes for that pass.
6. Re-capture the interface and save any screen files under `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/screens/`.
7. Ask the evaluator to score the new state and recommend `refine`, `pivot`, or `stop`, again passing the same run screenshot folder path.
8. Save the pass artifacts and post a concise in-chat summary.

### Polish Contract

Include only:

- target surface
- intended feel or visual thesis
- primary user action
- constraints that must not regress
- goal for this pass

### Pass Scope

- In evaluator-led mode, fix only 1-3 high-impact issues per pass.
- If the same blocker persists for two passes, do not keep polishing blindly. Re-evaluate the direction.
- When the evaluator recommends `pivot`, change the design direction before more incremental polish.
- When the evaluator recommends `stop`, do not chase cosmetic nits.

## Artifact Routing

For evaluator-led runs, store compact artifacts under `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/`.

Use this file set:

- `brief.md`
- `pass-01-eval.md`
- `pass-01-plan.md`
- `pass-02-eval.md`
- `summary.md`

Store screen captures only under:

- `.agents/polish-design/<run-id>/screens/`

Do not save screens under `docs/`, `docs/polish`, or any other documentation path.

Use a simple sequence-friendly naming structure inside `screens/`:

- `00-current.png` when there is only one baseline capture
- `01-before-pass-01.png`
- `02-after-pass-01.png`
- `03-before-pass-02.png`
- `04-after-pass-02.png`

The caller should pass the `screens/` folder path to the evaluator. Exact screenshot paths are optional.

## Chat Summary Format

Every evaluator-led pass must be summarized in chat in 3-5 short lines.

Use this shape:

```text
Pass 2/3 | Score 64 -> 71 | Recommendation: refine
Fixed: simplified hero hierarchy and removed card clutter
Top blocker: weak visual anchor in first viewport
Next move: strengthen imagery and CTA contrast
```

## Guardrails

- Always reference `frontend-skill` principles when judging design quality.
- The evaluator output must be skeptical, concise, and actionable.
- Do not drift into feature work or refactors unless a design blocker cannot be solved without them.
- Do not over-polish minor details while systemic problems remain.
- Preserve the repo's design language unless the user explicitly asks for departure.
- In evaluator-led mode, do not spawn subagents unless the user explicitly asked for them.
- The evaluator must never edit files.
- When invoking the evaluator, always pass the screenshot folder for the current run.
